# telegram-bot
This project is a Telegram bot that allows users to access educational videos categorized by grade level (Grades 10, 11, and 12). Users can interact with the bot via a custom keyboard to choose their grade and browse available content.

Features:
✅ Grade Selection – Users select from Grade 10, 11, or 12.
✅ Curriculum Videos – The bot provides pre-recorded videos stored locally.
✅ Previous Exams Section – Placeholder for exam resources.
✅ Interactive Keyboard – Users navigate using buttons instead of commands.
✅ Asynchronous File Handling – Uses aiofiles for efficient video file streaming.

Technologies Used:
🔹 Python – Main programming language.
🔹 python-telegram-bot – Telegram API integration.
🔹 aiofiles – Asynchronous file handling for videos.

How It Works:
1️⃣ The user starts the bot with /start.
2️⃣ A keyboard menu appears to choose a grade.
3️⃣ The user selects "Curriculum" to access videos.
4️⃣ The bot sends locally stored videos asynchronously.
5️⃣ Users can return to the main menu at any time.

This bot is ideal for students who want quick access to study materials via Telegram! 🚀📚
